# <b><i>LisTrello</i></b>
LisTrello is a Vue.js web application that produces formatted lists of Trello cards suitable for printing or forwarding from a mobile or desktop device. Also, the formatted cards may be copied and pasted into another application (such as Word) for additional manipulation. 

The code demonstrates various techniques, including:
* how to obtain and use authorisation tokens from Trello.com
* how to format output for printing
* how to submit a form when running on Netlify.com 

I use it for generating set lists for my band, I'm sure you can find many applications for it!

This application is available for use at https://listrello.netlify.com
