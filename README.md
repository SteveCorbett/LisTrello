# <b><i>LisTrello</i></b>
LisTrello is a Vue.js web application that produces formatted lists of Trello cards suitable for copying into another application (such as Word) for printing or further manipulation. It demonstrates a method of obtaining and using authorisation tokens from Trello.com.

I use it for generating set lists for my band, I'm sure you can find many applications for it!

This application is available for use at https://listrello.netlify.com
